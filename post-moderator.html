  <h1>What Makes a Good Web3 Moderator</h1>
  <p class="date">January 2026</p>

  <p>
    A good Web3 moderator is more than a chat manager.
    They act as a bridge between the team and the community.
  </p>

  <p>
    Key qualities include strong communication, patience,
    deep understanding of the product, and the ability to handle FUD.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moderators help maintain transparency, protect users,
    and foster long-term trust within the community.
