  <h1>Why Community Is the Core of Web3</h1>
  <p class="date">January 2026</p>

  <p>
    In Web3, users are not just customers — they are contributors, builders,
    and long-term stakeholders.
  </p>

  <p>
    A well-managed community builds trust, encourages participation,
    and protects the project from misinformation and toxic behavior.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moderators play a crucial role by maintaining clarity, fairness,
    and open communication between the team and the community.
